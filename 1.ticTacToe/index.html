        Tic tac toe v1.2
        21.03.2023
        Jan Grosicki | https://github.com/kenayv
        
        A simple Tic Tac Toe minigame game. This code may contain bugs or the solutions might be imperfect, however, making it perfect was not the point. That is my first web project that uses HTML+CSS+JS all together.

        If you are for some reason interested in using, improving, editing or redistributing the code, feel free to do that.

        Changes by V1.1{
            * added '.ticTacTable td::selection' selector that hides table cell elements on selection
            * Separated the logic to work strictly in JS.
                * JS engine doesn't use html element's content as a reference anymore, but relies on it's cells and cellNames arrays to handle events and check for wins.

                        '.' chars are put in table cells, so table won't
                        disform when some cells are empty and some are
                        filled with 'O' or 'X'.

                        Designing the table as 9 divs in 3x3 layout might
                        be a better idea.
